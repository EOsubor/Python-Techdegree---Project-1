The Number Guessing Game

In this project you will build a console game that will let you exercise the skills and concepts you have learned in the unit so far. This game is often called the Number Guessing Game or the Pick A Number game.

Have you ever played a game with your friends where you ask them to Pick a number between
some range of numbers like: "Pick a number between 1 and 10". Their job is to make a guess,
and you tell them whether their guess is too high or too low. 
Their next guess is based on what you've told them. 
If they guess the right answer the game is done. Normally you try to do this in the 
lowest number of tries possible. Often it is used to compete with friends to see who can get
the answer in the lowest number of guesses.








Python numbers guessing game. The game prompts user for an int input. It then compares the values
to a randomly generated value. If the guess is correct, the player is informed. Otherwise, the player
is given another chance to answer.

The final highscore is displayed at the end of the game. 
The player is also given the chance to replay.
